- When "Turning off" the GSM-R the button has to be pressed for 2 seconds or more. Otherwise it will attempt to start the registration/deregistration process.

- The registration string will be xXxx (Headcode/TRN) XXX (3 Digits of signal ID) which results in xXxx XXX.

An example string could be 9J47 993. (993 is the Southern/GTR wildcard.)

*The TRN is the train reporting number.*
